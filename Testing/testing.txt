/Testing the Parser

//Assert Testing
I have done carried out asssert testing for functions where this is possible
and not overly contrived. 
However, as this is a recursive descent parser it is difficult to test some 
functions in isolation. Instead I have written several .ttl scripts, each of 
which contain errors which should cause one of the functions which make up the 
parser to fail. By testing if the error messages output are as expected for these 
scripts, I can check if each function is working as expected.

///Changes made
    -ltr(): realised I needed to check strlen within the function to prevent
    e.g. Cabbage being a valid letter
    - added a boolean isvar flag to arguments of ltr() to prevent e.g. LOOP $C 
    from being parsed succesfully
