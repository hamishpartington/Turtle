/Testing the Parser

//Assert Testing
I have done carried out asssert testing for functions where this is possible
and not overly contrived. 
However, as this is a recursive descent parser it is difficult to test the functions in
isolation. Instead I have written several .ttl scripts, each of which contain 
errors which should cause one of the functions which make up the parser to error.
By testing if the error messages output are as expected for these scripts, I 
can check if each function is working as expected.
